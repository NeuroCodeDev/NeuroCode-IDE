# NeuroCode-IDE

NeuroCode-IDE is an accessible, beginner-friendly Arduino programming environment designed for neurodivergent learners and coding newcomers. It introduces a simplified syntax called **NeuroCode**, which translates into standard Arduino C++ automatically.

### ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Neuro-friendly Syntax** — Write commands like `blink LED 13 every 1s` instead of C++.
- 🛠️ **Real-time Translation** — Instantly converts NeuroCode to Arduino `.ino` files.
- 🧾 **Command Help Center** — Built-in searchable help with syntax, examples, and usage.
- ⚙️ **Auto-Compile & Upload** — Uses Arduino CLI to build and upload with one command.
- 🧪 **Live Error Suggestions** — Detects unrecognized commands and offers close suggestions.
- 🎨 **Console Interface** — Color-coded, line-numbered interactive menu with smart input.
- 🗂️ **Project Saving** — Save and open projects with custom folders and filenames.
- 🧾 **Export & Share** — Generate `.ino` files or export code to PDF for sharing and printing.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/installation/).
2. Clone or download this repo.
3. Build and run the solution in Visual Studio.
4. Use the interactive menu to write NeuroCode commands.
5. Compile and upload your code directly to your Arduino board.

### 📁 Example NeuroCode

```neurocode
turn on pin 13
wait 1 second
turn off pin 13
